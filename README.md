# Irregularity Zonal Drift :globe_with_meridians: #

## Abstract ##
The purpose of this work is to estimate the zonal drift velocity of irregularities occurring in the ionospheric medium. Those irregularities usually disturb the GPS signal propagation, causing a phenomena known as *scintillation*.

This work is based on Carrano's IPE technique [\[1\]][1].
